Forms made simple (and cute). Designless, multistep, conversational, secure, all-in-one WordPress forms plugin.

== Description ==

Formality is an all-in-one WordPress form plugin that puts design and user experience first. Each form is characterized by an **essential interface** and a **modern layout** that follows the most common UX patterns. No frills, no superfluous or overly characterized elements. No matter what theme you are using... with a few simple options you can quickly customize your forms and align them to your website design.

= Why choose Formality =

Formality is not the best nor the most complete form plugin. Formality does few things but it does them well and it continues to improve every day.

* **Designless** - Smart layout with simple UI and common UX patterns
* **Conversational** - Distraction-free form experience
* **Multistep** - Group your questions in multistep form
* **Simple** - Gutenberg-based form builder
* **Asyncronous** - Async data submit with WP REST API
* **Security** - Authentication with crypted time-based tokens
* **Logic condition** - Show/hide fields based on user answers
